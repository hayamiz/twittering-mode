 NEWS -- The history of twittering-mode
========================================

 HEAD: XXXX-XX-XX
------------------

### Important notice

#### Posting tweets with minibuffer is obsolete now.

There's two way to edit and post tweets in twittering-mode: with
minibuffer (existing way), and with pop-up buffer (new feature!).  You
can choose it by setting the variable
`twittering-update-status-function`. Currently its default value is
the existing way, `twittering-update-status-from-minibuffer`, but in
next release it will be changed to the new way
`twittering-update-status-from-pop-up-buffer`.

We recommend you to use the new feature by adding following code to
your `.emacs`:

    (setq twittering-update-status-function
          'twittering-update-status-from-pop-up-buffer)

The new feature, pop-up buffer, has several advantages over the
existing way.

* Not conflicting with input methods.
* Much less risk of posting halfway typed tweets by error.
* Visual assertion of length of tweets.

### Improvements

* Introduction of a concept 'timeline spec'.
* Pop-up buffer to edit and post tweets.
* Auto proxy setup with environment variables (http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY)
* Support for official ReTweet.
* Added some format specifiers of tweets.
* Displaying image files without temporary files.
* Support multiple buffers, where their name is derived from timeline spec.
* Multiple initial timelines by setting a list of timeline spec strings to
  the variable `twittering-initial-timeline-spec-string'.
* Toggle automatic retrieval of the timeline by pressing 'a'.
* Improved compatibility with global-font-lock mode.
* Unread statuses notifier on mode-line (experimental).
* Fixed fill-column for the format specifier "%FILL{...}".
* Switching timeline buffers by pressing 'f' or 'b'.
* Graphical indicators for SSL and ACTIVE/INACTIVE state on mode-line.
* Asynchronous retrieval of icon images.
* Deleting a tweet by inputting 'C-cD'.
* HTTPS connection using `tls' library working with an external command
  `gnutls' or `openssl' instead of `curl'.
* Individual proxy configurations for HTTP and HTTPS.
* Silent retrieval of icon images.
  You can enable silent retrieval by "(setq twittering-url-show-status nil)".
* ...

### Bug fixes

* Avoid SSL certificate error by embedding CA cert in code.
  * twittering-cert-file
  * twittering-ensure-ca-cert
* Fix URI (percent) encoding (thanks to IMAI Toshiyuki).
  * twittering-url-reserved-p
  * twittering-percent-encode
* Improved portability.
  * twittering-completing-read
* ...
* And lots of minor fixes
