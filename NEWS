### Important notice

### Improvements

* Support for storing private information in a file encrypted by master
  password. Once you save the authorized account by using master password,
  you have to input PIN no longer. This is enabled by
  `(setq twittering-use-master-password t)'.
  The private information is stored in `~/.twittering-mode.gpg', which can
  be specified by `twittering-private-info-file'.
  To enable master password, you need GnuPG and an additional Emacs LISP
  program, which is `alpaca.el' or EasyPG (Emacs23 includes EasyPG).
  To use with `alpaca.el', you should use the version 0.13. With other
  versions of `alpaca.el' the current implementation may not work well
  because it deeply depends on internal implementation of `alpaca.el'.
* Authentication via xAuth.
  You can enable xAuth by "(setq twittering-auth-method 'xauth)".

 1.0.0: 2010-06-05
------------------

### Important notice

#### Posting tweets with minibuffer is obsolete now.

There's two way to edit and post tweets in twittering-mode: with
minibuffer (existing way), and with pop-up buffer (new feature!).  You
can choose it by setting the variable
`twittering-update-status-function`. Currently its default value is
the new way, `twittering-update-status-from-pop-up-buffer`. If you
want to post from minibuffer, set the variable value to
`twittering-update-status-from-minibuffer`.

The new feature, pop-up buffer, has several advantages over the
existing way.

* Not conflicting with input methods.
* Much less risk of posting halfway typed tweets by error.
* Visual assertion of length of tweets.

### Improvements

* Introduction of a concept 'timeline spec'.
* Pop-up buffer to edit and post tweets.
* Auto proxy setup with environment variables (http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY)
* Support for official ReTweet.
* Added some format specifiers of tweets.
* Support for recursive format specifiers such as
  "%FILL{%FACE[bold]{%C{%m/%d}}: %T}".
* Support for user-defined prefix on filling by "%FILL[prefix]{...}".
* Displaying image files without temporary files.
* Support multiple buffers, where their name is derived from timeline spec.
* Multiple initial timelines by setting a list of timeline spec strings to
  the variable `twittering-initial-timeline-spec-string'.
* Toggle automatic retrieval of the timeline by pressing 'a'.
* Improved compatibility with global-font-lock mode.
* Unread statuses notifier on mode-line (experimental).
* Switching timeline buffers by pressing 'f' or 'b'.
* Graphical indicators for SSL and ACTIVE/INACTIVE state on mode-line.
* Asynchronous retrieval of icon images.
* Deleting a tweet by inputting 'C-cD'.
* HTTPS connection using `tls' library working with an external command
  `gnutls' or `openssl' instead of `curl'.
* Individual proxy configurations for HTTP and HTTPS.
  If `twittering-proxy-server' and `twittering-proxy-port' are non-nil,
  they have priority over the other variables `twittering-http-proxy-*' and
  `twittering-https-proxy-*'. To use individual proxies for HTTP and HTTPS,
  you must keep the prior variables (`twittering-proxy-server' and
  `twittering-proxy-port') nil.
* Silent retrieval of icon images.
  You can enable silent retrieval by "(setq twittering-url-show-status nil)".
* Authentication via OAuth.
  It requires a consumer information registered with Twitter and an external
  WWW browser to authorize a request token. Additionally, for SSL, it
  requires an external command `curl' or another command included in the
  variable `tls-program', which may be `openssl' or `gnutls-cli'.
  (Caution: Neither `openssl' nor `gnutls-cli' support SSL via proxy.)
  You can disable SSL for OAuth by "(setq twittering-oauth-use-ssl nil)".
  You can enable OAuth by "(setq twittering-auth-method 'oauth)".
  If `twittering-oauth-invoke-browser' is non-nil, twittering-mode
  automatically opens a browser on authorization.

### Bug fixes

* Avoid SSL certificate error by embedding CA cert in code.
  * twittering-cert-file
  * twittering-ensure-ca-cert
* Fix URI (percent) encoding (thanks to IMAI Toshiyuki).
  * twittering-url-reserved-p
  * twittering-percent-encode
* Improved portability.
  * twittering-completing-read
* And lots of minor fixes

-------------------

### Improvements

* Moved to GitHub.
* Brand new web site in English and Japanese.
* Secure sessions via HTTPS if 'cURL' is available.
* Lists support.
* Follow/remove support.
* Favorite/unfavorite support.
* Hash tag support.
* Direct message support.
* On-the-spot TinyURL-ize(tinyurl or to.ly).
* On-the-fly tweet length check.
* ReTweet format string.
* Remembers visited user names and tweets.
* Parameterized the number of tweets retrieved at a time.
* Walk through items(username, URL, etc) by TAB.
* Image type discriminant with 'file' program if available.
* More descriptive error messages on minibuffer.
* Do not discard old timeline data as possible.
* Suspend by hitting 'q'.
* Image file resize with 'convert' program(imagemagick) if available.
* Unit test framework was introduced.
* Support 'Proxy-connection: Keep-Alive'.
* Flexible format string function (twittering-format-string).
* Refactored 'twittering-format-status' by twitterint-format-string.
* More efficient HTTP response processing.

### Bug fixes

* URL cannot not be opened by mouse-click or Enter.
* Don't set the original status ID when retweeting.
* Wrong regexp for searching URL in status text.
* Username extraction from status text.
* Update mode-line immediately.
* Use a temporary buffer for each HTTP session.
* Use MD5 hash to distinguish image files with the same name.
* Check whether temp buffers are alive in sentinels before killing them.
* And some typos.
